<h1>IT Stock Management System</h1>
A Django project leveraging Django Unfold for improved admin design and functionality. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setup, database configuration, and resolving static file issues.

Installation and Setup
Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
To get started, install the following dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install django-unfold
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install mysqlclient
Step 2: Configure the Database
To use MySQL as your database, update the DATABASES settings in your settings.py file:

python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'your_table_name',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'yourhost.com',
    }
}
Step 3: Reset Migrations (if necessary)
If there are existing migration files, delete them to avoid conflicts. Then, run the following commands to apply the database schema:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Static Files Configuration
If the Unfold design is not displaying correctly, ensure your static files are configured properly in settings.py:

python
Copy code
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = '/yourserverstaticpath/'
Afterward, collect static files with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py collectstatic
Usage
Once all configurations are complete, you can start the development server and explore the Django Unfold design:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Troubleshooting
Unfold Design Not Showing
Ensure static files are correctly configured and collected as outlined in the Static Files Configuration section.

Database Connection Issues

Verify your MySQL credentials and host information in the DATABASES setting.
Ensure the required MySQL libraries (mysql-connector-python and mysqlclient) are installed.
